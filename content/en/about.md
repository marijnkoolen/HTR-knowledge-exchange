The HTR knowledge exchange meetings aim to share and gather knowledge about various aspects of digitizing, organizing, and analyzing large collections of historical sources. For example, HTR and OCR, document classification, layout recognition, and the use of metadata to improve these processes. These meetings are an initiative of Marijn Koolen (Huygens Institute) and Milan van Lange (NIOD).

This repository serves as a collection point for tips and tricks, useful links, discussion topics, and questions.
